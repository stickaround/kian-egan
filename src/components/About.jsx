          With over 8 years of experience in web development, I always try to
          produce high-quality code which is testable and scalable.
          <br />
          In the last 3 years of my career, I mainly focused on JavaScript
          frameworks and I built a number of websites for both startup and large
          enterprise-level companies.
          <br />
          I always provided 100% satisfying results for my clients. Not only in
          frontend but also, have a strong background in back-end development
          including Express, Django Rest Framework, and Laravel.
          <br />
          And strong communication skills and great teamwork skill are other
          fortes. When I do my task, I donâ€™t just complete it, I go the extra
          mile and make things better
